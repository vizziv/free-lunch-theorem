  \opening{Dear Dr.~David P. Williamson,}

  Attached is the manuscript ``Motors and Impossible Firing Patterns in the
  Parallel Chip-Firing Game'', by Tian-Yi Jiang, Ziv Scully, and Yan X Zhang,
  which we are submitting for consideration for publication in the \textit{SIAM
    Journal on Discrete Mathematics}. This submission is exclusive. A preprint
  of the manuscript is available on arXiv; the manuscript has not been released
  in any other form.

  The paper shifts the scope of known periodic behavior in the parallel
  chip-firing game, a discrete automaton on graphs, by both introducing a new
  constructive tool and proving certain periodic patterns impossible. The paper
  is of interest in mathematics, where the parallel chip-firing game has
  numerous connections to graph theory, and in physics, where our results may
  have implications for the parallel chip-firing game (in physics, also known
  as the discrete fixed-energy sandpile) viewed as a dynamical system.

  Please address correspondence regarding this manuscript to my address above
  or to my email, \texttt{ziv@mit.edu}. Thank you for your consideration!

  \closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
