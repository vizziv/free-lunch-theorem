\section{The Bellman-Ford Algorithm} \label{bfAlg}
The Python program below calculates $\G$ from \S~\ref{binSeq} and shows it has
no negative cycles. The authors have also confirmed this by hand. For a more
detailed description of the Bellman-Ford algorithm and a proof of its validity,
see~\cite{bellmanford}.\\
