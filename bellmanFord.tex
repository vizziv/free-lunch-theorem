\section{The Bellman-Ford Algorithm} \label{bfAlg}
The Python program in Figure~\ref{bfFig} confirms that $\G$ from
Section~\ref{binSeq} has no negative cycles. The authors have also confirmed
this manually by reducing the graph in a way that preserves cycles and their
weights until only edges of nonnegative weight remained. For more details on
the Bellman-Ford algorithm and a proof of its validity, see~\cite{bellmanford}.
