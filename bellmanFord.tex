\section{The Bellman-Ford Algorithm} \label{bfAlg}
The Python program below calculates $\G$ from Section~\ref{binSeq} and shows it
has no negative cycles. The authors have also confirmed this by hand. For a
more detailed description of the Bellman-Ford algorithm and a proof of its
validity, see~\cite{bellmanford}.\\
