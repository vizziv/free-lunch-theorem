The \emph{parallel chip-firing game} is an automaton on graphs in which
vertices ``fire'' chips to their neighbors. This simple model contains much
emergent complexity and has many connections to different areas of
mathematics. In this work, we study \emph{firing sequences}, which describe
each vertex's interaction with its neighbors in this game. First, we introduce
the concepts of \emph{motors} and \emph{motorized games}. Motors both
generalize the game and allow us to isolate local behavior of the (ordinary)
game. We study the effects of motors connected to a tree and show that
motorized games can be transformed into ordinary games if the motor's firing
sequence occurs in some ordinary game. Then, we completely characterize the
periodic firing sequences that can occur in an ordinary game, which have a
surprisingly simple combinatorial description.
