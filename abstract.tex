The \emph{parallel chip-firing game} is an automaton on graphs in which
vertices ``fire'' chips to their neighbors. This simple model contains much
emergent complexity and has many connections to different areas of
mathematics. In this work, we study the \emph {firing sequences}, which
describe each vertex's interaction with its neighbors in this game. First, we
introduce the concepts of \emph{motors} and \emph{motorized games}. Motors not
only generalize the game; they also allow us to isolate local behavior of the
(ordinary) game. We study the effects of motors connected to a tree, and show
that motorized games can be transformed into ordinary games if the motors'
firing sequences occur in some ordinary game. Then, we completely characterize
the periodic firing patterns that can occur in an ordinary game, which has a
surprisingly simple combinatorial description.
