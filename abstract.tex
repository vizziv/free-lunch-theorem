The \emph{parallel chip-firing game} is an automaton on graphs in which
vertices ``fire'' chips to their neighbors when they have enough chips to do
so. The game is always periodic, and we concern ourselves with the firing
sequences of vertices. We introduce the concepts of motorized parallel
chip-firing games and motor vertices, study the effects of motors connected to
a tree, and show that motorized games can be transformed into ordinary games if
the motors' firing sequences occur in some ordinary game. We then show that the
periodic firing patterns can occur in an ordinary game are exactly those
without both consecutive firing and consecutive waiting and state some
implications of the finding.
