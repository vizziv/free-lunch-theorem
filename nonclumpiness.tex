\section{Signed Sums of Binary Sequences}\label{binSeq}
Throughout this section, if $b \in \{0,1\}$, we may write $\ol{b} = 1-b$.

We take a break from the parallel chip-firing game to consider two binary
strings $p$ and $q$ of length $n$. We denote the $i$\xth element of $p$ as
$p_i$. For simplicity, any integer equivalent to $i \bmod n$ may replace
$i$. Let a \emph{$b$-sector} of $p$, where $b \in \{0,1\}$, be an integer
interval $[x,y]$ such that
\begin{align*}
  p_x = p_{y-1} = p_y &= b \\
  p_{x-1} = p_{x-2} &= \ol{b} \\
  \forall i \in [x+1, y-3]: p_i + p_{i+1} &\neq 2\ol{b}.
\end{align*}
That is, the image of a 0-sector is preceded by two 1s, starts with 0, ends
with two 0s and contains no two consecutive 1s. The same statements with 0s and
1s swapped are true for 1-sectors.

It is easy to see that almost any string can be partitioned into 0- and
1-sectors in exactly one way, with exceptions only for always-alternating
strings (e.g.\ 010101) that can be thought of as one 0-sector or one
1-sector. Figure~\ref{sectorEx} has an example.

\begin{figure}
  \[
    \underbracket[1pt]{01000100}\overbracket[1pt]{11011}\underbracket[1pt]{00}
    \overbracket[1pt]{101011}
  \]
  \caption{A string's 0-sectors (marked below) and 1-sectors (marked
    above). Roughly speaking, $b$-sectors have no two $\ol{b}$s in a row and
    extend as far left as possible.}
  \label{sectorEx}
\end{figure}

Let
\begin{align*}
  s_i(p) &= \begin{cases}
    -1 & \text{if $i$ is in a 0-sector of $p$} \\
    1 & \text{if $i$ is in a 1-sector of $p$}
  \end{cases} \\
  \delta_i(p) &= \begin{cases}
    0 & \text{if $i$ is in a $b$-sector of $p$ and $i+1$ is in a $b$-sector of
      $p$} \\
    1 & \text{if $i$ is in a $b$-sector of $p$ and $i+1$ is in a
      $\ol{b}$-sector of $p$}.
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}
Our main theorem in this section concerns the sum
\begin{equation}\label{misbsum}
  M_S(p,q) = \sum_{i \in S}(s_i(p)(p_i - q_{i-1}) + s_i(q)(q_i - p_{i-1}) -
  \delta_i(p) - \delta_i(q)),
\end{equation}
where $S \subseteq [0, n-1]$. This sum, superficially speaking, measures each
sequence's ``disagreement'' with the other shifted back one step minus the
number of sector switches. The rules of the parallel chip-firing game put a
global upper bound on the total disagreement between vertices, yet the
following theorem says that sector switches require disagreement. We show in
Section~\ref{nonclumpiness} that this implies that firing sequences with sector
switches are impossible once a game has become periodic.

\begin{thm}\label{morale}
$M_{[0,n-1]}(p,q) \geq 0$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
We can caculate $M_{[0,n-1]}(p,q)$ as $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}M_{\{i\}}(p,q)$, and
$M_{\{i\}}(p,q)$ is determined by $p_{i-1}$, $p_i$, $s_i(p)$, $s_{i+1}(p)$, and
the same data for $q$. The motivation for using $s_{i+1}(p)$ as opposed to
$s_{i-1}(p)$ in $\delta_i(p)$ is that a switch away from a $b$-sector can occur
between $i$ and $i+1$ only if $p_{i-1} = p_i = b$. Let
\[
  \mu_i(p,q) = (p_{i-1},p_i,s_i(p),s_{i+1}(p),q_{i-1},q_i,s_i(q),s_{i+1}(q))
\]
and let $\G$ be a weighted digraph with
\begin{align*}
  \V[\G] &= \set{\mu_i(p,q)}{p,q \text{ strings}, i \in \nats} \\
  \E[\G] &= \set{(u,v,w)}{\exists p,q,i\colon
    u = \mu_i(p,q),
    v = \mu_{i+1}(p,q),
    w = M_{\{i\}}(p,q)}.
\end{align*}
(The third item of each edge is its weight.) Note that not every possible tuple
is a vertex. Define the weight of a path to be the sum of the weights of its
member edges, and call a path negative if it has negative weight. We can
calculate the $M_{[0,n-1]}(p,q)$ as the weight of a path induced by the
sequence of vertices $(\mu_0(p,q), \dots, \mu_{n-1}(p,q),
\mu_0(p,q))$. Therefore, it suffices to show that $\G$ has no negative
cycles. Running the Bellman-Ford algorithm~\cite{bellmanford} on $\G$ shows
this to be the case. We describe $\G$ and the algorithm in a Python program in
Figure~\ref{bfFig}.

\section{Nonclumpiness of Periodic Firing Patterns}\label{nonclumpiness}
We consider parallel chip-firing game $\s$ on undirected graph $G$. The
\emph{periodic firing pattern} (PFP) of a vertex $v \in \V$ is the binary
string
\[
  \firing{v}{t_0}\dots\firing{v}{t_0 + \period - 1},
\]
where $t_0$ is the smallest natural number such that $\pos{t_0}$ is
periodic. We write the PFP of $v$ as $\pfp{v}$. For simplicity, we assume here
that $t_0 = 0$ and index PFPs modulo $\period$.

Let $\pfps$ be the set of all PFPs occurring in $\s$. Call a PFP with both
consecutive 0s and consecutive 1s \emph{clumpy}, and let $\cpfps$ be the set of
all clumpy PFPs occurring in $\s$. (Recall that the $\period$\xth and 0\xth
entries of a PFP are the same, so, for example, 011010 is clumpy.) It is known
that, given any nonclumpy PFP, one can construct a parallel chip-firing game on
a simple cycle in which every vertex has that PFP shifted by some number of
steps~\cite{cycle}. We prove here that clumpy PFPs cannot occur in any parallel
chip-firing game, showing that a PFP is possible if and only if it is nonclumpy.

\begin{lem}\label{strongbg}
For all $v \in \V$ and $a, b \in \nats$,
\begin{equation}\label{local}
  -\deg{v} + 1 \leq \sum_{t=a}^{b}(\receiving{v}{t-1} - \deg{v}\firing{v}{t})
  \leq \deg{v}-1.
\end{equation}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
We express $\chips{v}{b}$ in terms of $\chips{v}{a-1}$.
\begin{align*}
  \chips{v}{b} &= \chips{v}{a-1} +
  \smashoperator{\sum_{t=a-1}}^{b-1}(\receiving{v}{t} - \deg{v}\firing{v}{t})
  \\
  \chips{v}{b} - \deg{v}\firing{v}{b} &= \chips{v}{a-1} -
  \deg{v}\firing{v}{a-1} + \sum_{t=a}^{b}(\receiving{v}{t-1} -
  \deg{v}\firing{v}{t})
\end{align*}
Recall that $0 \leq \chips{v}{t} - \deg{v}\firing{v}{t} \leq \deg{v} - 1$ for
all $t \in \nats$ such that $\pos{t}$ is periodic, which gives the desired
inequality.
\end{proof}

We define
\begin{align*}
\pfpverts{p} &= {\set{v \in \V}{\pfp{v}=p}} \\
\pfpedges{p}{q} &= {\set{\{v,w\} \in \E}{\pfp{v}=p, \pfp{w} = q}} \\
\misb{S}{p}{q} &= \sum_{i \in S}(p_{i} - q_{i-1})
\end{align*}
for binary strings $p$ and $q$. We now prove our main result: clumpy PFPs do
not occur in the parallel chip-firing game.

\begin{thm}\label{nct}
$\size{\pfpverts{p}} = 0$ for all $p \in \cpfps$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Roughly, summing an inequality given by Lemma~\ref{strongbg} over all vertices
with clumpy PFPs gives a lower bound on the same quantity, and summing an
inequality given by the Theorem~\ref{morale} over all edges incident with a
vertex with a clumpy PFP gives an upper bound on the same quantity. The lower
bound is the total number of vertices with clumpy PFPs, and the upper bound is
0.

Let $a,b \in \nats$ and $v \in \V$. Grouping the sum in \eqref{local} by $v$'s
neighbors instead of time steps yields
\[
  -\deg{v} + 1 \leq -\smashoperator{\sum_{w \in
      \N{v}}}\misb{[a,b]}{\pfp{v}}{\pfp{w}} \leq \deg{v} - 1.
\]
Regrouping gives us
\[
  1 \leq \smashoperator{\sum_{w \in \N{v}}}(1 +
  r\misb{[a,b]}{\pfp{v}}{\pfp{w}}),
\]
where $r = \pm1$. Let $p \in \pfps$. The above summed over $v \in \pfpverts{p}$
is
\[
  \size{\pfpverts{p}} \leq \smashoperator{\sum_{\substack{v \in \pfpverts{p}
        \\\ w \in \N{v}}}}(1 + r_v\misb{[a,b]}{p}{\pfp{w}}),
\]
where each $r_v = \pm1$ can depend on $v$. (Notation: ranges for outer sums are
above ranges for inner sums.)

For all $p \in \pfps$, let $\sctr{p}$ be the set of sectors of $p$. Abusing
notation slightly, we may write $s_X(p)$ instead of $s_i(p)$ if $i \in X \in
\sctr{p}$. Because each $X \in \sctr{p}$ is of the form $[a,b]$ for some $a,b
\in \nats$, we can sum the above inequality over $X \in \sctr{p}$ and $p \in
\cpfps$ to get
\begin{equation}\label{almost}
  \smashoperator[r]{\sum_{p \in \cpfps}}\size{\pfpverts{p}} \leq
  \smashoperator{\sum_{\substack{
        p \in \cpfps \\ v \in \pfpverts{p} \\
        w \in \N{v} \\ X \in \sctr{p}
  }}}(1 + r_{v,X}\misb{X}{p}{\pfp{w}}),
\end{equation}
where each $r_{v,X} = \pm1$ can depend on $v$ and $X$.

Let $p \in \cpfps$ and $q \in \pfps$. If $q$ is clumpy, then
\[
  M_{[0,\period-1]}(p,q) =
  \smashoperator{\sum_{X \in \sctr{p}}}(s_X(p)\misb{X}{p}{q} - 1) +
  \smashoperator{\sum_{X \in \sctr{q}}}(s_X(q)\misb{X}{q}{p} - 1).
\]
The $-1$ in each sum accounts for the $-\delta_i(p)-\delta_i(q)$ term in
\eqref{morale}, the definition of $M$. If instead $q$ is not clumpy, then
$\sctr{q} = \{[0,\period-1]\}$, so
\[
  M_{[0,\period-1]}(p,q) =
  \smashoperator{\sum_{X \in \sctr{p}}}(s_X(p)\misb{X}{p}{q} - 1) +
  s_{[0,\period-1]}(q)\misb{[0,\period-1]}{q}{p}.
\]
However, $\misb{[0,\period-1]}{q}{p} = 0$ because $p$ and $q$ have the same
length and number of 1s.

Let $W = \set{v \in \V}{\pfp{v} \in \cpfps}$ be the set of vertices with clumpy
PFPs. Choosing $r_{v,X} = -s_X(\pfp{v})$ and splitting the sum in
\eqref{almost} between neighbors with and without clumpy PFPs yields
\begin{align*}
  \smashoperator[r]{\sum_{\substack{
        p \in \cpfps \\
        X \in \sctr{p}
  }}}\size{\pfpverts{p}} &\leq
  \smashoperator{\sum_{\substack{
        p \in \cpfps \\ v \in \pfpverts{p} \\
        w \in \N{v} \cap W \\ X \in \sctr{p}
  }}}(1-s_X(p)\misb{X}{p}{\pfp{w}}) +
  \smashoperator{\sum_{\substack{
        p \in \cpfps \\ v \in \pfpverts{p} \\
        w \in \N{v} \setminus W \\ X \in \sctr{p}
  }}}(1-s_X(p)\misb{X}{p}{\pfp{w}}) \\
  &=
  \smashoperator[l]{\sum_{\substack{
        p,q \in \cpfps \\
        e \in \pfpedges{p}{q}
  }}}\!\!\Bigg(\smashoperator[r]{\sum_{X \in \sctr{p}}}(1-s_X(p)\misb{X}{p}{q})
  + \smashoperator{\sum_{X \in \sctr{q}}}(1-s_X(p)\misb{X}{q}{p})\Bigg)
  \\ &\qquad + 
  \smashoperator{\sum_{\substack{
        p \in \cpfps \\ v \in \pfpverts{p} \\
        w \in \N{v} \setminus W \\ X \in \sctr{p}
  }}}(1-s_X(p)\misb{X}{p}{\pfp{w}}) \\
  &= -\smashoperator{\sum_{\substack{
        p,q \in \cpfps \\
        e \in \pfpedges{p}{q}
  }}}M_{[0,\period-1]}(p,q) -
  \smashoperator{\sum_{\substack{
        p \in \cpfps \\
        v \in \pfpverts{p} \\ w \in \N{v} \setminus
        W}}}M_{[0,\period-1]}(p,F(w)) \\
  &\leq 0.
\end{align*}
The last line follows from Theorem~\ref{morale}, and when we sum over $p,q \in
\cpfps$, we consider $p$ and $q$ unordered. (A sum over $\{p,q\} \subseteq
\cpfps$ is one alternative notation.) Sets have nonnegative sizes, so
$\size{\pfpverts{p}} = 0$ for all $p \in \cpfps$.
\end{proof}
