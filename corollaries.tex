\section{Implications of Nonclumpiness} \label{corollaries}
It is a basic property of the parallel chip-firing game that every vertex fires
the same number of times each period~\cite{jiang}. This means, roughly
speaking, that every periodic game is either ``mostly waiting'' with bursts of
firing or ``mostly firing'' with bursts of waiting. (In fact, there is a
bijection between these two types of games. Each periodic game has a complement
that inverts firing and waiting~\cite{jiang}.) This is because if a vertex
waits twice in a row, then because it therefore never fires twice in a row, it
fires less than half the time over the course of a period. Similarly, a vertex
that fires twice in a row fires more than half the time. We cannot have a
vertex that waits twice in a row and a vertex that fires twice in a row in the
same periodic game because each vertex fires the same number of times each
period.

\begin{cor}
Once a parallel chip-firing game is periodic, either no vertex fires twice in a
row or no vertex waits twice in a row.
\end{cor}

That is, in periodic games, a firing sequence is possible if and only if it is
nonclumpy.

The \emph{interior} of a set of vertices $W$ is $\set{v \in W}{N(v) \subseteq
  W}$. Because a waiting (or firing) vertex with only waiting (or firing)
neighbors will wait (or fire) the following turn as well, the above observation
proves the following conjecture of Fey and Levine~\cite{privateComms}.

\begin{cor}\label{feyLevine}
Once a parallel chip-firing game is periodic, the interior of the set of
waiting vertices is always empty, the interior of set of firing vertices is
always empty, or both interiors are always empty.
\end{cor}

Interestingly, Corollary~\ref{feyLevine} also implies Theorem~\ref{nct}. If
clumpy PFPs were possible, then a leaf attached to a motor with a clumpy PFP
would be at different times in both the waiting and firing interiors.

In one of the first papers on the parallel chip-firing game, Bitar and Goles
characterized parallel chip-firing games on trees in~\cite{bitarGoles}.
Corollary~\ref{freeLunch} and Theorem~\ref{nct} allow us to characterize the
behavior on tree-like subgraphs---subgraphs that, if an edge to a root vertex
is cut, become a tree separated from the rest of the graph---by making the root
vertex a motor.

\begin{cor}
Let $\s$ be a periodic game on $G$ with period at least 3 in which no vertex
fires twice in a row, $H$ be a tree-like subgraph of $G$, and $m \in \V[H]$ be
the root of $H$. Then for all $v \in \V[H]$,
\[
  \chips{v}{t} = \begin{cases}
    \deg{v} & \textnormal{if } \firing{m}{t-D} = 1 \\
    0 & \textnormal{if } \firing{m}{t-D-1} = 1 \\
    \deg{v} - 1 & \textnormal{otherwise},
  \end{cases}
\]
where $D$ is the distance from $m$ to $v$. An analogous result holds if no
vertex waits twice in a row.
\end{cor}

In some sense, tree-like subgraphs are passive in that their vertices fire only
in response to their root-side neighbor firing. In a periodic game, we can
completely remove tree-like subgraphs without affecting the PFPs of the other
vertices.

\begin{cor}
Let $\s$ be a periodic game on $G$, leaf $l \in \V$ have single neighbor $m$,
and $G'$ be $G$ with $l$ deleted. Then a game $\s'$ exists on $G'$ with the
same firing behavior as $\s$.
\end{cor}

The starting position $\pos[\s']{0}$ can agree with $\pos{0}$ completely except
for possibly removing a chip from $m$. We consider the case where no vertex
fires twice in a row. Compared to $\s'$, vertex $m$ has to have an extra chip
to fire in $\s$.  However, unless $m$ fired the previous turn---which, because
$l$ is a leaf, is equivalent to saying $l$ is firing this turn---$m$ will have
received the extra chip back from $l$, so removing both $l$ and the chip has no
effect on $m$ as long as $m$ does not fire while $l$ has a chip, which doesn't
happen due to nonclumpiness. The other case is analagous. This corollary
concerns a leaf, though the result generalizes to all tree-like subgraphs by
repeated application, providing an alternate proof of
Corollary~\ref{freeLunch}.
