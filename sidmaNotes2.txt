p11, l-3: Shouldn't it be "s_X(q)m_X(q,p)" instead of "s_X(p)m_X(q,p)"?
=> Actually fixed. (This is now page 12, line -9.)

One more style correction on page 13, line 25: removed the redundant final "in" from "In one of the first papers on the parallel chip-firing game, Bitar and Goles characterized parallel chip-firing games on trees in [4]."
