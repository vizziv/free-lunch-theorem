*** Reviewer 1. ***

Section 3, definition of X: isn't that simply called 'outer boundary'?
=> We now refer to it as the 'boundary'.

The terms 'clump' and 'burst' are used with the same meaning; I suggest to add the definition of a 'clump', as an interval in a max-clump, at the bottom of page 4.
=> We have added this definition of clump and used the term to clarify the section, getting rid of the R_f(v) notation entirely. For instance, instead of saying [a,b] \subseteq R_f(v), we say that [a,b] is an f-clump of v.

Lemma 3.1: Add here some clarifying sentence like 'we say that w "follows" the burst/clump of v'. I kept getting confused in the proof of this lemma.
=> We now use the phrase 'supported by' and added an intuitive outline of the proof.

page 5, line -12: Is it necessary that [a0,b0] is a max-clump of v0, or is a clump sufficient? And I suggest to use i and i+1 instead of i-1 and i.
=> We use the fact that [a_i, b_i] is a max-clump of v_i to ensure that the sequence of vertices doesn't backtrack. We now use i and i+1 instead of i-1 and i.

Corollary 3.3: 'tree M' should be 'tree T'.
=> Fixed.

page 7, line -2: replace 'We know...' by 'We now know that...'.
=> We now use that clearer phrasing.

page 8, first formula: I believe several instances of 'v' should be 'm', and one sigma' should be sigma^m.
=> Fixed. We also realized that we use 'm' in several places we should use 'u_m' and fixed that as well.

page 8, line 10: change v into u, in accordance with the theorem statement.
=> Changed.

page 8, line 12-17: Why make this brief remark outside the proof? I suggest to put it inside instead, so that the theorem can be stated more generally.
=> We have removed the remark and slightly generalized the theorem.

Section 5: The terms 'string' and 'sequence' are used with no clear distinction. If they are the same, then use only one, otherwise, explain the difference.
=> Other than in the section's title, which we believe is clearer to someone who doesn't have knowlegde of the section's contents, we now use 'string' exclusively, using 'sequence' only in the phrase 'firing sequence', which has a well-defined different meaning, and in unrelated contexts such as 'sequence of vertices'.

page 8, line -16: 'For simplicity... ' This is a very unclear phrasing. The n-periodicity is not merely simple, it is essential for the proof to work.
=> We have removed 'for simplicity'.

formula (5.1): introducing S is not necessary, in the remainder only S = [0,n-1] is used. I am not even sure if the proof is valid for other S.

page 9, line -13: 'Note that not every tuple is a vertex'; an example would be helpful here.

page 9, line -9: ' ...has no negative cycles'; add 'in particular, no negative cycles of length n' for clarity.

page 11, line 3: replace ' ...can depend on v' by ' ...may be chosen dependent on v'. Similar in line 10.

page 11, line 5: 'Abusing notation slightly... '; move this line below (6.2) because this notation is not used yet in (6.2).

formula (6.2): in the left sum, the summing over X is missing.

page 11, line -7: 'Choosing ...': replace F(v) by p.

Corollary 7.1: I suggest to replace 'reaches a periodic position' by 'is periodic'.

Corollary 7.2: This statement is incorrect. I suspect that the authors mean to define A for some a in N, and then take the union over all a of I(A), and similar for B. And then at least one of the unions is empty, because they can also both be empty.

Corollary 7.3: 'T >= 3': according to the author's notation T should be T^sigma, but I suggest 'period at least 3'.
=> Changed to 'period at least 3'.


*** Reviewer 2 ***

Theorem 6.2's characterization of Periodic Firing Patterns (PFP) has interesting implications as discussed in Section 7. Unfortunately, the theorem is written in a cryptic way. The authors should find a better way of stating it, hopefully partly in words rather than just a formula whose parsing requires to recursively figure out the meaning of the notation introduced so far. Also, the proof of Theorem 6.2 is a bit dry, I encourage the authors to provide (in words) motivation/intuition/interpretation for the formulas derived and the notation introduced.

Theorem 5.1: It is not good style to begin a phrase with a math expression, neither to have a theorem be just a formula. Also, terms should be properly quantified. Furthermore, theorem statements should be as self-contained as possible, its annoying to read a statement and have to go and search for the definition of the terms it involves. Please improve this aspect of the presentation (in the statement of this result and elsewhere).

At the end of Section 5 (page 9), the authors state that G has no negative cycles by running the Bellman Ford (BF) algorithm. Can the authors give a formal proof (hopefully more insightful) for this statement (one that does not rely on running BF)? In any case, at least you should include a discussion regarding the size of the graph on which BF needs to be executed.

p 10, l 13: The authors write "Recall that 0 \leq \delta_t(v) âˆ’ d(v)F_t(v) \leq d(v)-1...", where was this result stated? Is it obvious? Please elaborate.

Section 6: The main result is to prove that clumpy PFPs do not occur in the parallel chip-firing game. I understand that this statement means that the set Q is empty, correct? However, the authors write "for all p \in Q", but in fact Q is empty! Please clarify.

p10, l18: You should say that S is a set of indexes.

p10, l-3: the equation needs some more detailed explanation.

p11, l-3: Shouldn't it be "s_X(q)m_X(q,p)" instead of "s_X(p)m_X(q,p)"?

p11, displayed equations at the bottom: Please provide justification for at least the first inequality and the last identity.
